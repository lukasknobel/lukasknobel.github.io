I am an <a href="https://ellis.eu/">ELLIS PhD candidate</a> in the Fundamental AI Lab at the University of Technology Nuremberg, supervised by <a href='https://yukimasano.github.io/'>Yuki Asano</a>. I am co-supervised by <a href='https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew-zisserman/'>Andrew Zisserman</a> (Visual Geometry Group) at the University of Oxford. Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Scientist at TNO in the Netherlands. My academic background includes an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam and a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Engineering, completed in collaboration with Airbus. My research focuses on self-supervised learning for vision and multimodal foundation models.
