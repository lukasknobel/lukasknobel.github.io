I am a PhD student in the Fundamental AI Lab at the University of Technology Nuremberg, supervised by Yuki Asano. Prior to this, I have worked as a Machine Learning Scientist at TNO in the Netherlands. My background includes an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam and a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Engineering, a program I pursued in collaboration with Airbus. My main interest is in self-supervised learning for vision and multi-modal foundation models.
