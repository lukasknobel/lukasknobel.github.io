I am a Machine Learning Scientist at TNO's Intelligent Imaging group. My background includes an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam and a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering, a program I pursued in collaboration with Airbus. My main interests are in computer vision, self-supervised learning, and foundation models.
