  abstract={Our work attempts to verify two methods to mitigate forms of inequality in ride‐pooling platforms proposed in the paper Data-Driven Methods for Balancing Fairness and Efficiency in Ride-Pooling: (1) integrating fairness constraints into the objective functions and (2) redistributing income of drivers. We extend this paper by testing for robustness to a change in the neighbourhood selection process by using actual Manhattan neighbour‐hoods and we use corresponding demographic data to examine differences in service based on ethnicity},
