  abstract={Our work attempts to verify two methods to mitigate forms of inequality in ride‐pooling platforms proposed in the paper Data-Driven Methods for Balancing Fairness and Efficiency in Ride-Pooling: (1) integrating fairness constraints into the objective functions and (2) redistributing income of drivers. We extend this paper by testing for robustness to a change in the neighbourhood selection process by using actual Manhattan neighbour‐hoods and we use corresponding demographic data to examine differences in service based on ethnicity.},

      abstract={While recent supervised methods for reference-based object counting continue to improve the performance on benchmark datasets, they have to rely on small datasets due to the cost associated with manually annotating dozens of objects in images. We propose Unsupervised Counter (UnCo), a model that can learn this task without requiring any manual annotations. To this end, we construct "SelfCollages", images with various pasted objects as training samples, that provide a rich learning signal covering arbitrary object types and counts. Our method builds on existing unsupervised representations and segmentation techniques to successfully demonstrate the ability to count objects without manual supervision. Our experiments show that our method not only outperforms simple baselines and generic models such as FasterRCNN, but also matches the performance of supervised counting models in some domains.},
